# Data_Structures
Personal implementations of data structures 

## Structures
  * Doubly-Linked List
      * Templated structure 
      * Supports O(N) search, insert, deletion, and accessor functions
  * Skip List
      * Templated structure 
      * Supports probablistic O(logN) search, insertion, and deletion 
  * Binary Tree
      * Templated structure 
      * Supports O(logN) (worst case O(N)) search, insertion, and deletion
      * Can contain any data type that has a strict weak ordering (overloads the > operator)
  * Heap
      * Templated structure
      * Supports O(1) access to the top element, O(logN) insertion and deletion
      * Can contain any data type that has a strict weak ordering (overloads the > operator)
  * String Tree
      * Scalable data structure that contains strings
      * Supports O(M) search, insert, and deletion where M is the length of the string

## Planned:
  * Red-Black Tree
  * Splay Tree
